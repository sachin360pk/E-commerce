                <h4>Pav Bhaji</h4>
                <p>
                    Pav Bhaji is a native Maharashtrian dish made with an assortment of mashed vegetables, pan-fried on a large tawa and served with Pav toasted in butter. It is immensely popular all across the country because of its spicy and tangy zest. The generous dose of butter that is often used with freshly-cut onions and lemon juice tops the dish. Pav Bhaji is also a great way to feed fussy kids their share of veggies with a smile! You can also serve Pav Bhaji in a bruschetta/canapé style for your next party.

                <h4>Rajma Chawal</h4>
                <p>
Step 1 Soak rajma overnight and pressure cook till they are soft
Wash the rajma and allow it to soak in water overnight. Wash it again and pressure cook with 2 cups of water, 1/2 tsp salt and turmeric. Once the rajma is soft and squishy, remove it from the heat and keep it aside.

Step 2 Chop onion-tomato and make ginger-garlic paste
Finely chop onions and keep aside, grate the tomatoes and keep them aside. Make a paste of ginger, garlic and green chillies.

Step 3 Prepare the rajma
In a deep bottomed pan, add mustard oil, when it gets heated add green cardamom, black cardamom, cinnamon, clove, peppercorn. Once they become fragrant, add onions and cook till they are golden brown. Now add the tomatoes and cook on high for 4-5 minutes. Add ginger- garlic-chilli paste, cumin powder, coriander powder and black pepper powder. Cook till the spices become fragrant and oil starts leaving the sides of the pan. Now add the rajma and one cup of water. Mix well and cook covered for 10 minutes. Once done, add the ghee. You can garnish with coriander leaves. Your rajma is ready.

Step 4 Steam cook rice and serve with Rajma
To make steamed rice without using a pressure cooker, wash 1 cup of rice in running water. Then, add them to a large and deep-bottomed pan with 4-5 cups of water in it. You can also add a little salt to it for taste. Once the rice is soft and double its size, strain the water. Spread the rice on a plate and allow it to cool for 2-3 minutes. Once the rice is done, serve hot with prepared Rajma.

                <h4>Pasta</h4>
                <p>
                    1. First rinse and shred or chop all the veggies, then set aside. You will need 1 cup shredded cabbage, ½ shredded carrots, 8 to 10 french beans (thinly sliced or finely chopped), ⅓ sliced capsicum and ⅓ cup chopped spring onion whites.

Increase the quantity of veggies according to your preferences. Add some cremini or button mushrooms if you like.
2. Next heat 5 to 6 cups of water in a pan.5. Then add the noodles (about 200 grams). I have used whole wheat noodles. The recipe is customizable with any noodles – instant, ramen, soba, chow mein, udon, rice.

                <h4>Fish Fry</h4>
                <p>
                    Step 1 Clean the fish pieces
                    Fish Fry is the easiest starter recipe, which can be prepared without a putting in much efforts. Begin with washing the fish pieces thoroughly under running water. Pat dry and keep aside in a strainer till the water drains out.Step 2 Marinate the fish
                    Take a tray and marinate with yoghurt, garlic paste, ginger paste, turmeric and salt. If you want to make it more spicy and flavoursome, add finely chopped green chilies along with some finely chopped coriander leaves. Although, this will slightly change the traditional fish fry but at the same it will enhance the taste. Add all the ingredients (except oil) to the fish and mix well. Keep aside for half an hour.Step 3 Deep fry it to perfection
                    Now heat oil in a deep fry pan to shallow fry the fish pieces one by one, keeping the flame low. Drain the fried fish pieces and place on an absorbent paper to remove excess oil.Step 4 Serve Fish Fry hot
                    Serve the Fish Fry hot with green chutney and onion rings. You can also serve it with mustard sauce or any dip!

                <h4>Chole Bhatura</h4>
                <p>
                    Even the bhature size and flavor varies from restaurants to restaurants. The bhature ideally should be less oily and should puff fully. They should also be eaten hot and fresh. If you parcel the bhature from a restaurant then you won’t get the real taste as they become limp and dense.

I always make the bhatura recipes that are already posted on the blog. I have not yet tried making any other version of bhatura as these work best for me always.The chickpeas have to be cooked really well. They should not be just cooked or al dente, the way they are served in many restaurants. They should be soft when cooked and melt in your mouth. However, care should be taken that they should not be overcooked or become mushy.
